Devi (English: "The Goddess") is a 1960 Bengali-language drama film that explores the themes of religion, superstition, and patriarchy in rural India. The film was directed by the acclaimed filmmaker Satyajit Ray, who also wrote the screenplay based on a short story by Provatkumar Mukhopadhyay. The film features Sharmila Tagore in her breakthrough role as Doyamoyee, a young woman who is worshipped as a goddess by her father-in-law after he has a dream. Soumitra Chatterjee plays her husband Umaprasad, who is torn between his love for his wife and his rationality. Devi is considered one of Ray's finest works and a masterpiece of Indian cinema.
  
The film is set in the late 19th century, when India was under British colonial rule. Umaprasad and his elder brother Taraprasad are educated in Calcutta and have modern views on science and society. Their father, Kalikinkar, is a wealthy landlord who lives in a village and follows traditional Hindu rituals and beliefs. He has a large family of wives, sons, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren.

One night, Kalikinkar has a vivid dream in which the goddess Kali tells him that his daughter-in-law Doyamoyee is an incarnation of her. He wakes up convinced that Doyamoyee is a divine being and starts worshipping her as such. He builds a temple for her in his house and invites the villagers to seek her blessings. Doyamoyee is initially shocked and confused by this turn of events, but gradually accepts her role as a goddess out of obedience and devotion to her father-in-law.
  
Umaprasad, who is away in Calcutta, learns about his father's madness and his wife's predicament from a letter sent by his brother. He rushes back to the village to rescue Doyamoyee from the delusion. However, he faces resistance from his father, who accuses him of being a blasphemer and an enemy of the faith. He also finds that Doyamoyee has lost touch with reality and believes that she is indeed a goddess. He tries to reason with her and remind her of their love, but she rejects him as a mere mortal. Umaprasad is devastated and helpless as he watches his wife slip away from him.
